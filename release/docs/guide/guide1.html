    If you're interested in learning how to develop with Jace, you've come to the right place, but first things first. If you've never used JNI before, you're going to be absolutely lost. No class library or set of tools can be an adequate substitute for the knowledge that you'll gain by reading through the freely available <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jni/">Java Native Interface Programmer's Guide</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/index.html">Java Native Interface Specification</a>. Your time will have been well spent.

    You've probably already got a development platform in mind, or perhaps two or three. Jace is excellent for cross-platform development, because it's built using only the standard C++ library and a JDK 1.4 or later compiler. Here's a matrix of all of the known Jace compatible compilers, operating systems, and architectures. If your favorite compiler/os/arch isn't listed, download the source and give the build a try. You're likely to experience a pleasant surprise.

    If you haven't already, you may download Jace from <a href="http://jace.reyelts.com/jace">http://jace.reyelts.com/jace</a> or <a href="http://sf.net/projects/jace">http://sf.net/projects/jace</a>. You'll get a jace[XXX].jar file (where XXX is the version of Jace being downloaded) which you can then simply extract using your favorite zip tool (for example, Winzip) or the JDK's jar utility. This is what you should see:

    The release folder contains all of the binaries and tools you need to use Jace. It consists of the following folders:
      <ul>
        <li>bin - The proxygen, batchgen, autoproxy, and peergen code-generation tools. </li>
        <li>docs - The documentation necessary to use Jace - including what you're staring at right now. </li>
        <li>examples - Several example programs used to demonstrate the features available in Jace. </li>
        <li>include - The header files that you need to #include when you develop with Jace. </li>
        <li>lib - Debug and release binaries of the Jace Runtime Library (JRL) for a few platforms (for example, Windows and Linux).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    The source folder contains the source used to build the JRL and code-generation tools. This is where you can go to build your own version of the JRL if Jace didn't come with pre-built binaries for your platform. The source directory has the following folders:

    <ul>
      <li>c++/include - The C++ header files required to build the JRL. </li>
      <li>c++/lib - The makefiles and scripts used to build the JRL for several platforms. </li>
      <li>c++/source - The C++ source files required to build the JRL. </li>
      <li>java/source - The Java source files required to build the entire set of code-generation tools.</li>
      <li>java/classes - An intermediary build directory for the Java classes. </li>
    </ul>
